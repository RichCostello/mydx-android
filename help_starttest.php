<h3>
  Help - Start Test</h3>
  <p>This is where you would start the test of the sample.  To do this, simply touch the "START" option.</p>
  <p>Once started it will simulate a strain match and allow you to add this into your internal database.  This is only for demo purposes until the device ships.</p>
    
  <h3>App Menus</h3>
<p>The hexagon on the bottom right brings up the quick menu and allows you to do a simulated quick test (demo mode) and easily get to your profile.</p>
<p>The rectangular box on top right brings up the main app menu.  This allows you to quickly get to search, forums, education, your profile, settings, and log out.</p>
